# Pro.APIConsume
A single page application that fetches and display data from [Helsinki Region Transport HSL Open Data](https://www.hsl.fi/en/hsl/open-data) - Park &amp; Ride Information System API. 

## Table of contents
Welcome to my new single-page application, built with:

* [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) and [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/?redirectedfrom=MSDN) for cross-platform server-side code
* [React](https://react.dev/) for client-side code
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for layout and styling

Here, I have also enabled:

* Client-side navigation. For example, click Counter then Back to return here.
* Development server integration. In development mode, the development server from create-react-app runs in the background automatically, so client-side resources are dynamically built on demand and the page refreshes when any file is modified.
* Efficient production builds. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and dotnet publish configuration produces minified, efficiently bundled JavaScript files.

The ClientApp subdirectory is a standard React application based on the create-react-app template. Open a command prompt in that directory, run [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) commands such as npm test or npm install.
